## Tasks
The following are the tasks available:

### [#0 - Yagna Setup](tasks%2F0-yagna-setup)
Install and configure the Yagna daemon on your machine to allow you to run tasks on the Golem Network.

### [#1 - Text2Speech](tasks%2F1-text-2-speech)
Create a script that uses Golem to generate text-to-speech audio, allowing users to easily generate audio files without needing to install text-to-speech software locally. 

### [#2 - Code Sandbox](tasks%2F2-code-sandbox)
Build a web-based code sandbox that can execute code on the Golem Network, allowing users to compile and execute code directly from their web browser.

### [#3 - Parallel File Conversion](tasks%2F3-parallel-file-conversion)
Create a Node.js script that uses Golem to perform image file conversions in parallel, allowing users to convert multiple images in different formats simultaneously.

### [#4 - Best Provider Selection](tasks%2F4-best-provider-selection)
Create a Node.js script that selects the best provider to run a Golem task based on factors such as price, reliability, and performance. 

### [#5 - Text2Speech Server](tasks%2F5-text-2-speech-server)
Prepare for a bigger scale and allow any user to interact with your API. This will serve as a gateway that schedules tasks on Golem and forwards the results.
